# Membership System
This is a system for managing membership and payment to South London Makerspace.

## Setup

You need to install and run mongodb as described [here](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

Clone the repo. 

You will need to create your config.json file. You can do this by copying the example-config.json.

Then run:
```
npm update
```

### Configuration

You can automatically compile your css as you edit the less files by running:
```
npm run watch
```

To run the application now requires nodemon. Install it by running:
```
npm install -g nodemon
```
Then you can start the application:

```
npm start
```

By default it will then be available on `http://localhost:3001/`
The port is configurable in the  `config/config.json`
